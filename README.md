GGM Media was a proof-of-concept project I built about a year ago, designed to be an Instagram clone.
It is built in Swift, the Apple language. At the time it was built, it had a functioning Firebase backend, 
but I stopped upkeep of the backend after I ran out of free usage on my Firebase account. All Firebase implementation code is still there. 
TECH STACK:
- Swift
- Firebase
